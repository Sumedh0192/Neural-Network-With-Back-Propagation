################# Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network ################

### Concept: 
A Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network has been implemented to classify handwritten digits.

### Implementation:
* A collection of handwritten images consisting of numbers is passed as the input data. 
* The data is split into 3 sets. Training Data, Testing Data and Validation Data.
* Outliers and unnecessary image pixels are removed in order to reduce image features.
* The classification is done by predicting the class labels of the images based on the weights obtained by minimizing the error, which is calculated after Forward Feed of input Data and Back Propogation of errors.
* A report has been provided which lists down the effects of various parameters used in the algorithm on the final result obtained.
